# Pokedex-

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Professor Oak has been discovering more new Pokemon than he knows what to do with lately. He has
hired you to create a Pokemon catalog program that will make gathering new Pokemon data and
searching through it easier.

To simplify your task, the Professor has provided you with their current Pokemon information. These
come in the form of a text file that contains a list of the currently discovered Pokemon and their moves,
all of the information that your program will display.
